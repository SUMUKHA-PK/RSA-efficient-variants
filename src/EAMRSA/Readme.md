# The Encrypt Assistant Multi-Prime RSA

**Description of the algorithm:**  
1. Key generation: Input is a security parameter *n*, and three other parameters *b*, *k* and *c*. Private and Public keys are generated by the following steps:
    * Compute *b* distinct prime *p<sub>1</sub>,p<sub>2</sub>,....p<sub>b</sub>*, where each one is floor(n/b) bits in length and compute *N* = p<sub>1</sub>*p<sub>2</sub>*...*p<sub>n</sub> . 
    * Compute *d* = (1/e)mod(phi(N)) where *phi* is *Eulers phi function* i.e phi(N) = (p<sub>1</sub>-1)*(p<sub>2</sub>-1)*....*(p<sub>n</sub>-1) and *e* = 65537 and *e* and *phi(N)* are relatively prime. 
    * Compute r<sub>i</sub>
